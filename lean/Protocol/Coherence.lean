# MPST Coherence

This module defines the coherence invariant for multiparty session types.

In binary session types, coherence states that after consuming in-flight messages,
dual endpoints have dual types. In MPST, this generalizes to:

**For each directed edge (p → q) in session s:**
1. The sender's local type G[s,p] is consistent with what was sent on D[s,p,q]
2. The receiver's local type G[s,q] is consistent with what must be received on D[s,p,q]
3. The communication patterns match: sends to q align with branches from p

## Consume Function

The `Consume` function models how a local type evolves as buffered messages arrive.
For role p's view:
- `Consume L [] = some L` (no messages → unchanged)
- `Consume (recv q T L) (T :: ts) = Consume L ts` (receive consumes a message)
- `Consume (branch q bs) _ = ...` (branch must handle incoming label)

## Coherence Invariant

`Coherent G D` states that for every session and every **active** directed edge:
- Sender's continuation after sending matches what's in the queue
- Receiver's continuation after consuming matches sender's intent

## Proof Technique: Edge Case Analysis

The key preservation proofs (`Coherent_send_preserved`, `Coherent_recv_preserved`)
proceed by case analysis on which edge we're checking coherence for:

1. **e = updated edge**: The sender's/receiver's local type changed, trace changed
2. **e involves modified endpoint**: The other endpoint of e was modified
3. **e unrelated**: Neither endpoint was modified, environments unchanged at e

This 3-way case split is the core proof technique for coherence preservation.
Adapted from binary session types where the split is: a = e, a = e.dual, a unrelated.
