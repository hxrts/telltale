# MPST Verified Monitor

This module implements the proof-carrying runtime monitor for MPST.

## Overview

The monitor is the trusted component that:
1. Tracks protocol state (local types, in-flight messages, buffers)
2. Validates each protocol action before execution
3. Updates state to reflect completed actions
4. Maintains invariants that metatheory proves are preserved

## Monitor State

The `MonitorState` structure contains:
- `G`: GEnv mapping endpoints to their current local types
- `D`: DEnv tracking in-flight message type traces per edge
- `bufs`: Runtime message buffers per directed edge
- `Lin`: Linear context tracking capability tokens
- `supply`: Fresh session ID counter

## Monitor Transitions

`MonStep` is the judgment for valid monitor transitions. Each constructor
corresponds to a protocol action (send, recv, select, branch, newSession).

The key theorem `MonStep_preserves_WTMon` states that valid transitions
preserve the well-typedness invariant.

## Untrusted Code Interface

Untrusted code interacts with the monitor by:
1. Presenting a capability token
2. Requesting an action
3. Monitor validates action matches token's type
4. Monitor updates state and returns new token

This ensures untrusted code can only perform actions allowed by the protocol.
