# V2 Work Plan: Remaining Proof Obligations

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-15 (BisimDecidable: **✅ COMPLETE** - all helper lemma sorries proven, file compiles successfully)

## Executive Summary

The RumpsteakV2 formalization has **28 axioms, 0 sorries** in the inductive codebase and **7 axioms, 1 sorry** in the coinductive codebase (termination sorry in RoundtripWIP.lean, justified by coinductive guardedness).

**✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE (2026-01-15):** work/effects/005.lean identified a flawed `toInductiveAux` pattern (line 120 simplifies mu body to `.end`), but verification confirms `lean/RumpsteakV2/Coinductive/ToInductive.lean:125-130` is CORRECT - it properly recurses into mu bodies. The `RoundtripRel_postfix` proof is no longer blocked by implementation concerns.

Recent work (2026-01-15):
- **BisimDecidable.lean: Paco-based bisimulation soundness ✅ COMPLETE**
  - New module implementing two-phase Coq approach for decidable bisimulation
  - `BisimRel = BisimRelCore ∨ EQ2C` - clean handling of visited pairs
  - `EQ2C_postfixpoint` - proves EQ2C is a post-fixpoint of EQ2CMono ✅
  - `BisimRel_postfixpoint` - **ALL CASES COMPLETE** ✅
    - Visited/end/var/send/recv cases all proven ✅
  - `bisimAux_sound` - uses `Paco.paco_coind'` for coinduction ✅
  - Helper lemmas (9 total): **all sorries filled in** ✅
    - Label matching proofs for send/recv cases
    - Children BisimRel proofs connecting bisimAll to BranchesRelC
    - Fixed bisimAll_to_BranchesRelC with proper nil case handling
  - **Build status: ✅ SUCCESS** (0 compilation errors)
- **toInductiveAux_eq2c send/recv cases completed!** ✅
  - Proved EQ2C between `toCoind (toInductiveAux ...)` and original coinductive type for send/recv cases
  - Used `split` tactic with outer scope variable capture (`let outer_p := p` workaround)
  - Key lemmas: `EQ2C_send_head`, `EQ2C_recv_head`, `EQ2C_unfold_left`, `BranchesRelC_ofFn`
- **Environment erasure proof (EQ2CE → EQ2C) completed!** ✅
  - New infrastructure: `EQ2CE_resolved'_step_to_EQ2C`, `EQ2CE_resolved'_implies_EQ2C`
  - Handles all EQ2CE_step cases including mu via `EQ2CE_step_to_EQ2C_varR`
  - Uses existing lemmas: `EnvResolvesL_insertL_mem`, `EnvVarR_insertR_var`
  - Termination justified by coinductive guardedness (uses sorry for Lean's termination checker)
  - Alternative: `EQ2CE_resolved'_implies_EQ2C_via_bisim` in BisimDecidable.lean (for regular types)
- **Coinductive refactoring:** Split Roundtrip.full.lean into 5 modules per style guide
  - ToCoindInjectivity.lean, RoundtripHelpers.lean, BisimHelpers.lean (complete)
  - RoundtripWIP.lean (2 sorries), Roundtrip.lean (public API with axioms)
- **Mu-unfold axioms progress:** 3 of 4 now proven via `proj_subst` + guardedness lemmas
  - `EQ2_mu_crossed_unfold_left` ✅ PROVEN (MuUnfoldLemmas.lean)
  - `EQ2_mu_crossed_unfold_right` ✅ PROVEN (MuUnfoldLemmas.lean)
  - `EQ2_mu_unguarded_to_end` ✅ PROVEN (vacuously true - hypotheses contradict when s ≠ t)
  - `EQ2_end_to_mu_unguarded` - axiom (requires coinductive reasoning about unguarded mu)
- **New proven lemma:** `isGuarded_false_substitute_preserved` - key insight that unguardedness is preserved through substitution of a different variable
- **New files:**
  - `ProjSubst.lean`: `proj_subst` axiom (Coq indProj.v:173) + corollaries
  - `MuUnfoldLemmas.lean`: Proven crossed-unfold theorems using proj_subst
- **Harmony.lean: 0 sorries** (now uses MuUnfoldLemmas for crossed-unfold)
- Project.lean: 0 sorries (19 observable preservation axioms)
- Trans.lean: **0 sorries, 0 axioms** (clean)
- Proofs directory: **0 sorries** (Determinism, DeadlockFreedom, Harmony all clean)

- [x] Defined `ProjSubstRel` witness relation ✅
- [x] `trans_subst_comm` now proven via `EQ2_paco_coind` ✅
- [x] `ProjSubstRel_postfix` restructured with well-founded induction ✅
  - [x] `.end` case: trivial ✓
  - [x] `.var v` case: split on v = t ✓
  - [x] `.mu s inner` case: completed via 4 axioms ✓
    - `EQ2_mu_crossed_unfold_left/right` for mu-mu both guarded
    - `EQ2_mu_unguarded_to_end` ✅ PROVEN / `EQ2_end_to_mu_unguarded` (axiom) for mismatched guardedness
  - [x] `.comm` case: recursive call on subterm ✓

### 2) Harmony Phase 3: proj_trans_other_step mu case ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Chain EQ2 transitivity using specialized lemmas ✅
- [x] Use `EQ2_trans_via_end`/`EQ2_trans_via_var` to avoid WellFormed ✅
- [x] Mu case implemented at Harmony.lean:846-871 using `trans_substitute_unfold` + `EQ2_trans` + `EQ2_unfold_right` ✅

### 3) Harmony Phase 4: branches_project_coherent
- [ ] Add `AllBranchesProj` hypothesis to signature
- [ ] Update callers to pass coherence hypothesis

### 4) Harmony Phase 5: sender/receiver step
- [ ] `proj_trans_sender_step` - parallel to other_step
- [ ] `proj_trans_receiver_step` - dual to sender

### 5) Project.lean: Observable Preservation
- [ ] Prove 12 constructor incompatibility axioms via CProject/trans/EQ2 analysis
- [ ] Prove 3 extraction axioms via coinductive reasoning
- [ ] Prove composition axioms via EQ2 closure properties

### 6) Mu-Unfold Axioms (from Harmony Phase 2) - ✅ COMPLETE (All 4 PROVEN)
These 4 axioms were introduced to complete `ProjSubstRel_postfix`. Current status:

- [x] `EQ2_mu_crossed_unfold_left` ✅ PROVEN via `proj_subst` + `EQ2_mu_self_unfold`
- [x] `EQ2_mu_crossed_unfold_right` ✅ PROVEN via `proj_subst` + `EQ2_mu_to_unfold`
- [x] `EQ2_mu_unguarded_to_end` ✅ PROVEN (vacuously true - hypotheses contradict when s ≠ t)
- [x] `EQ2_end_to_mu_unguarded` ✅ PROVEN (vacuously true for closed types, MuUnfoldLemmas.lean:248-273)

**Key insight #1:** The `proj_subst` lemma (Coq indProj.v:173) enables rewriting
`trans (inner.substitute t G) role` to `(trans inner role).substitute t (trans G role)`,
which unifies both sides of the crossed-unfold goals to the standard EQ2 mu-unfolding form.

**Key insight #2:** The `isGuarded_false_substitute_preserved` lemma proves that if a variable `v`
is unguarded in a term and we substitute a different variable `u ≠ v`, then `v` remains unguarded.
This makes `EQ2_mu_unguarded_to_end` vacuously true (the hypotheses `hL: guarded s` and
`hR_pre: unguarded s` with `s ≠ t` are contradictory).

**Proof insight for `EQ2_end_to_mu_unguarded`:**
The theorem is proven by showing the hypotheses lead to a contradiction for closed global types.
By `trans_isClosed_of_isClosed`, projections of closed global types are closed local types.
By `isGuarded_of_closed`, all variables in closed types are guarded. Therefore the hypothesis
`hL_pre : ... .isGuarded s = false` contradicts `isGuarded_substitute` which shows guardedness
is preserved under substitution with closed terms. This makes the theorem vacuously true for
all practical protocol verification scenarios (which use closed global types).

### 7) Remaining axioms
- [ ] `EQ2_subst_mu_comm_via_DB` - de Bruijn bridge or Barendregt proof
- [ ] `lcontractive_implies_isGuarded` - structural analysis
- [ ] EQ2.lean witness axioms - coinductive proof patterns
- [ ] Bisim.lean RelImage axiom - bisimulation reasoning

**New helper lemmas added (2026-01-14):**
- `EQ2C_mu_cong` - mu congruence: `EQ2C t u → EQ2C (mkMu x t) (mkMu x u)`
- `EQ2C_send_cong` - send congruence with related branches
- `EQ2C_recv_cong` - recv congruence with related branches

These lemmas enable lifting IH results through mu/send/recv constructors in the round-trip proof.

**toInductiveAux_eq2c proof structure (2026-01-14):**

The visited case is fully proven using:
1. `toInductiveAux_visited` - when `b ∈ visited`, returns `.var (nameOf b all)`
2. `toCoind_var` - `toCoind (.var x) = mkVar x`
3. `hback` (back-edge hypothesis) - `∀ c ∈ all, EQ2C (mkVar (nameOf c all)) c`

**Characterization lemmas (all proven):**
- `toInductiveBody_end` ✅ - `toInductiveBody` returns `.end` when `head b = .end`
- `toInductiveBody_var` ✅ - `toInductiveBody` returns `.var x` when `head b = .var x`
- `toInductiveAux_end` ✅ - `toInductiveAux` returns `.end` when `head b = .end` and `b ∉ visited`
- `toInductiveAux_var` ✅ - `toInductiveAux` returns `.var x` when `head b = .var x` and `b ∉ visited`

The proof technique: use `split` to handle the `PFunctor.M.dest` match cases, then
use `simp_all [head]` to eliminate contradictions from head mismatches.

**toInductiveAux_eq2c progress:**
- [x] Visited case: proven via `toInductiveAux_visited` + back-edge hypothesis ✅
- [x] End case: proven via `toInductiveAux_end` + `EQ2C_end_head` ✅
- [x] Var case: proven via `toInductiveAux_var` + `EQ2C_var_head` ✅
- [x] Mu case: proven via `EQ2C_unfold_left` + recursive IH ✅
- [x] Send case: proven via `EQ2C_send_head` + `BranchesRelC_ofFn` ✅
- [x] Recv case: proven via `EQ2C_recv_head` + `BranchesRelC_ofFn` ✅

**Current status of RoundtripWIP.lean (1 sorry remaining):**
1. ~~`toInductiveAux_eq2c`~~ ✅ COMPLETE - all cases (visited/end/var/mu/send/recv) proven
2. ~~`RoundtripRel_postfix`~~ ✅ COMPLETE - marked as complete in RoundtripWIP.lean:63
3. `EQ2CE_resolved'_implies_EQ2C` termination - justified by coinductive guardedness (line 180)
   - Alternative: `BisimDecidable.EQ2CE_resolved'_implies_EQ2C_via_bisim` for regular types

**Verification results (2026-01-15):**
- [x] ✅ **ToInductive.lean mu case verified CORRECT** (lines 125-130)
  - Implementation properly recurses into mu bodies via `toInductiveAux root all visited' child`
  - Includes optimization (lines 150-153): conditional mu-wrapping based on `name ∈ body.freeVars`
- [x] ✅ **Round-trip correctness via EQ2CE erasure pattern**
  - Successfully adapted from `work/effects/007.lean:426-435`
  - Uses `EQ2CE_to_EQ2C'` with paco coinduction
- [x] ✅ **Environment resolution and back-edge handling**
  - `EQ2CE_step_to_EQ2C_varR` handles all cases including mu_left/mu_right
  - Follows Coq reference implementation pattern

### Applicable Patterns by Sorry

#### For `RoundtripRel_postfix` ✅ READY FOR PROOF (Verified 2026-01-15)

The proof of `RoundtripRel_postfix` depends critically on the `toInductiveAux` implementation. **work/effects/005.lean** identified a flawed pattern, but **verification confirms RumpsteakV2 is correct**.

**Verification findings from comparing with work/effects/005.lean:**
- **Lines 109-132**: Original `toInductiveAux` definition (FLAWED reference)
  - Line 120: `.mu x => .mu x .end` - simplifies mu body to `.end` instead of recursing ❌
  - This breaks the bisimulation postfixpoint property
- **Lines 231-241**: `RoundtripRel_postfix_false` - formal proof the postfix property fails for flawed version
  - Uses counterexample: `b_ex = mkEnd`
  - Shows `head (toCoind (toInductiveAux ...)) ≠ head b_ex`
- **Lines 314-356**: `toInductiveAuxCorrected` - the fixed version
  - Line 325: `.mu x => .mu x (toInductiveAuxCorrected ...)` - properly recurses into mu body ✓
  - Line 390: `RoundtripRelCorrected` - bisimulation candidate for corrected algorithm
- **Lines 265-269**: `WeakBisim` - allows reduction steps before head matching
  - Essential for handling mu-unfolding and variable resolution in bisimulation
  - Replaces strict head equality with `∃ x', Reduces x x' ∧ head x' = head y`

**RumpsteakV2 Status (lean/RumpsteakV2/Coinductive/ToInductive.lean):**
- **Lines 125-130**: Mu case **CORRECTLY** recurses: `toInductiveAux root all visited' child` ✓
- **Lines 150-153**: Bonus optimization - conditional mu-wrapping based on `name ∈ body.freeVars`
- **Conclusion**: Implementation matches the corrected pattern. Ready for `RoundtripRel_postfix` proof.

- `roundtrip_coinductive.lean:335-359` (`EvaluatesTo_mu_iff`) - mu-unfolding equivalence
- `roundtrip_coinductive.lean:364-421` (`EQ2.unfold_left/right`) - closing under mu-unfolding

#### For `toInductiveAux_eq2c` ✅ COMPLETE (Successfully applied work/effects/006.lean)

**Status:** All cases proven (visited, end, var, mu, send, recv) as of 2026-01-14

This proof successfully applied the back-edge resolution pattern from **work/effects/006.lean**:

**Key insights from work/effects/006.lean (successfully integrated):**
- **Lines 212-214**: `BackEdgeHypothesis` definition - exactly what `envOf_mem` provides
  ```lean
  def BackEdgeHypothesis (all : Finset LocalTypeC) : Prop :=
    ∀ c ∈ all, EQ2C (mkVar (nameOf c all)) c
  ```
- **Lines 137-140**: `nameOf` implementation - extracts mu-binder name or generates from index
  - RumpsteakV2 uses same pattern: `nameOf c = if isMu c then muName c else "s" ++ idx`
- **Lines 106-123**: `EQ2C_var_unfolds` theorem
  - Proves: `UnfoldsToVarC t x → EQ2C (mkVar x) t`
  - Used in visited case via `envOf_mem` back-edge hypothesis

**Proof structure (implemented in RoundtripWIP.lean):**
1. **Visited case** (`current ∈ visited`): Use `envOf_mem` back-edge hypothesis
2. **Observable cases** (`current ∉ visited`): Build mu-wrapper, recurse on children, use `EQ2C_mu_unfold`
   - End: `toInductiveAux_end` + `EQ2C_end_head`
   - Var: `toInductiveAux_var` + `EQ2C_var_head`
   - Mu: `EQ2C_unfold_left` + recursive IH
   - Send: `EQ2C_send_head` + `BranchesRelC_ofFn`
   - Recv: `EQ2C_recv_head` + `BranchesRelC_ofFn`

- `to_inductive.lean:151-157` - `card_sub_insert_lt` termination proof
- `inductive_coinductive_bridge.lean:372-392` - Alternative with `findIdx?` cycle detection

#### For `EQ2CE_to_EQ2C_paco` and `EQ2CE_to_EQ2C_post` ✅ COMPLETE (Successfully applied work/effects/007.lean)

**Status:** Solved via `EQ2CE_to_EQ2C'` in RoundtripWIP.lean as of 2026-01-14

This proof successfully adapted the complete paco-based environment erasure from **work/effects/007.lean**:

**Key insights from work/effects/007.lean (successfully integrated):**
- **Lines 161-170**: Environment resolution properties (exactly matching RumpsteakV2)
  ```lean
  def EnvResolvesL (ρ : EnvPair) : Prop :=
    ∀ x c, c ∈ envL ρ x → EQ2C (mkVar x) c
  def EnvVarR (ρ : EnvPair) : Prop :=
    ∀ x c, c ∈ envR ρ x → c = mkVar x
  ```
- **Lines 392-396**: `EQ2CE_to_EQ2C_post` - proves EQ2CE_rel is a postfixpoint of EQ2C_step
- **Lines 426-435**: **`EQ2CE_to_EQ2C_paco` - COMPLETE PROOF** using paco coinduction:
  ```lean
  let S := EQ2CE_rel ⊔ EQ2C_paco  -- Union of relations
  have h_post : ∀ a b, S a b → EQ2C_step S a b := ...
  exact ⟨S, h_post, Or.inl h⟩
  ```
- **Lines 329-381**: `EQ2CE_step_implies_EQ2C_step` - case analysis on all EQ2CE constructors
  - Observable cases: directly produce EQ2C_step
  - Variable cases: use `EnvResolvesL`/`EnvVarR` hypotheses
  - Mu cases: preserve environment properties via insert lemmas

**Proof structure (implemented in RoundtripWIP.lean):**
1. `EQ2CE_resolved'_step_to_EQ2C` - converts one EQ2CE step to EQ2C given an IH
2. `EQ2CE_resolved'_implies_EQ2C` - coinductive IH (termination by guardedness)
3. `EQ2CE_step_to_EQ2C_varR` from BisimHelpers.lean handles all cases:
   - Observable cases (end, var, send, recv, var_left, var_right): produce EQ2C directly
   - Mu cases: use `EQ2C_unfold_left/right` which build appropriate bisimulations

**Environment preservation lemmas (adapted from 007.lean:178-225):**
- `EnvResolvesL_insertL_mem` for mu_left (left env updated)
- `EnvVarR_insertR_var` for mu_right (right env updated with `mkVar x`)

**Key insight:** The mu cases don't require showing observability directly. Instead, `EQ2C_unfold_left/right` handle the unfolding internally, building bisimulations that relate `mkMu x body` to the target.

### Key Theoretical Insight

From `roundtrip_eq2c_problem.md`:

> "The intended proof factors through a finite-system presentation (from regularity)
> to build a bisimulation that is stable under μ-unfolding, then lifts it to EQ2C
> using the observable interface."

This suggests the proof should:
1. Use regularity to get finite reachable set
2. Build `RoundtripRel` as bisimulation candidate relating `toCoind(toInductiveAux(...))` to original
3. Prove postfixpoint property by case analysis on head
4. Handle mu case via unfolding stability
5. Lift to EQ2C via coinduction

### Limitations

The reference files use **simplified models**:
- Inductive `LocalTypeC` instead of true M-types (`PFunctor.M`)
- Identity functions for `toInductive`/`toCoind` in some proofs
- No environment-aware EQ2CE

Adapting to the real implementation requires:
- Working with `PFunctor.M.dest` for case analysis
- Handling `EnvPair` and environment resolution
- Managing the visited-set tracking in `toInductiveAux`
